cpi.csv is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as of 2014-01-16 from the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics for All Urban Consumers - (CPI-U), as a U.S. city average 
for all items, with 1982-84=100.

The FTP server that handles the transfer of this file is down for some reason
as of my commit of this file. Plus, I believe you will appreciate a ready-to-use CSV format rather than the disruptive whitespace the BLS currently places
in the file.
